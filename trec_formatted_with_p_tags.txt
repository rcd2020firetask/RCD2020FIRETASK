<p>close the window. It was blowing on my neck. </p>
<p>it seems to me that it's up to us to convince this gentleman (indicating NO. 8) that we're right and he's wrong. Maybe if we each took a minute or two, you know, if we sort of try it on for size.</p>
<p>table. </p>
<p>guilty. I thought it was obvious. I mean nobody proved otherwise.is on the prosecution. The defendant doesn't have to open his mouth. That's in the Constitution. The Fifth Amendment. You've heard of it. </p>
<p>I . . . what I meant . . . well, anyway, I think he was guilty. </p>
<p>man who lived on the second floor right underneath the room where the murder took place. At ten minutes after twelve on the night of the killing he heard loud noises in the upstairs apartment. He said it sounded like a fight. Then he heard the kid say to his father, "I'm gonna kill you.!” A second later he heard a body falling, and he ran to the door of his apartment, looked out, and saw the kid running down the stairs and out of the house. Then he called the police. They found the father with a knife in his chest. </p>
<p>movies. That's a little ridiculous, isn't it? He couldn't even remember what pictures he saw. </p>
<p>right. </p>

<p>the picture. I didn't say it proved anything. </p>
<p>day about this thing, but I think we’re wasting our time. Look at the kid's record. At fifteen he was in reform school. He stole a car. He's been arrested for mugging. He was picked up for knife-fighting. I think they said he stabbed somebody in the arm. This is a very fine boy.</p>
<p>regularly. He used his fists. </p>
<p>don't listen. I've got a kid. When he was eight years old, he ran away from a fight. I saw him. I was so ashamed, I told him right out, "I'm gonna make a man out of you or I'm gonna bust you up into little pieces trying." When he was fifteen he hit me in the face. He's big, you know. I haven't seen him in three years. Rotten kid! You work your heart out.... All right, let's get on with it. </p>

<p>What about the ones that were asked? For instance, let's talk about that cute little switchknife. You know, the one that fine, upright kid admitted buying.</p>
<p>at it. I'd like to see it again, Mr. Foreman.</p>
<p>look at it again. What do yo: We all know what it looks like. I don't see why we have to look at it again. What do you think? </p>
<p>don't you agree? </p>
<p>being slapped by his father.</p>
<p>switch knife. The storekeeper was arrested the following day when he admitted selling it to the boy. It's a very unusual knife. The storekeeper identified it and said it was the only one of its kind he had in stock. Why did the boy get it? As a present for a friend of his, he says. Am I right so far?</p>
<p>what he's talking about. </p>
<p>fallen through a hole in his coat pocket, that he never saw it again. Now there's a story, gentlemen. You know what actually happened. The boy took the knife home and a few hours later stabbed his father with it and even remembered to wipe off the fingerprints.</p>
<p>are you trying to tell me that someone picked it up off the street and went up to the boy's house and stabbed his father with it just to be amusing?</p>
<p>and that someone else stabbed his father with a similar knife. It's possible.</p>
<p>never seen one like it before in my life and neither had the storekeeper who sold it to him.</p>

<p>an elevated train going at top speed to pass a given point? </p>
<p>given point is the window of the room in which the killing took place. You can almost reach out of the window of that room and touch the el. Right? All right. Now let me ask you this. Did anyone here ever live right next to the el tracks? I have. When your window is open and the train goes by, the noise is almost unbearable. You can't hear yourself think. : This. An el train passes a given point in ten seconds. That given point is the window of the room in which the killing took place. You can almost reach out of the window of that room and touch the el.

<p>one second later he heard a body fall. One second. That's the testimony, right? </p>
<p>last two cars of the el and saw the body fall. Right? The last two cars. </p>
<p>per car. That el had been going by the old man's window for at least six seconds and maybe more, before the body fell, according to the woman. The old man would have had to hear the boy say, "I'm going to kill you," while the front of the el was roaring past his nose. It's not possible that he could nave heard it.</p>

<p>That is insanity, Max.</p>
<p>Or maybe it's genius. I have to get that number.</p>
<p>Hold on, you have to slow down. You're losing it, you have to take a breath. Listen to yourself. You're connecting a computer bug I had, a computer bug you might have had, and some religious hogwash. If you want to find the number two sixteen in the world, you'll be able to pull it out of anywhere. Two hundred and sixteen steps from your street comer to your front door. Two hundred and sixteen seconds you spend riding on the elevator. When your mind becomes obsessed with anything, it will filter everything else out and find examples of that thing everywhere. Three hundred and twenty, four hundred and fifty, twenty-three. Whatever! You've chosen two sixteen and you'll find it everywhere in nature. But Max, as soon as you discard scientific rigor, you are no longer a mathematician. You become a numerologist. What you need to do is take a break from your research. You need it. You deserve it Here's a hundred dollars, I want you to take it. If ,you won't take it, borrow it. Either way, take a break. Spend it however you like as long as it falls in the category of vacation. Real world stuff, okay. No math.</p>
<p>Just try it. In a week you'll laugh about this. C'mon, Max. Think about it!	</p>
<p>Mr. Cohen? Mr. Cohen? Please stop for a second Mr. Cohen?</p>
<p>Damn it already! Stop following me. I'm not interested in your money. I'm searching for a way to understand our world. I'm searching for perfection. I don't deal with mediocre materialistic people like you!</p>
<p>I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. I admit I've been a bit too aggressive. But all I ask is for five minutes of your time. Here...</p>
<p>...a stopwatch. Already ticking. Allow me the four and a half minutes left Let me tell you what I want. Let me tell you what I can offer you. Afterwards, if you don't want to talk to me, then fine, we part as friends and I promise that you will never see me again. That's fair, isn't it?	</p>
<p>Go.	</p>
<p>Good. It's funny, even though we have different aims and different goals we're actually incredibly alike. We both seek the same thing—perfection. I know... clearly we're seeking different types of perfection, but that is what makes us perfect candidates for a fruitful partnership. If you let me, I can be your greatest ally. Take the acacia tree...in East Africa. It is the most prevalent plant in all of Kenya because it has managed to secure its niche by defeating its major predator, the giraffe. To accomplish this, the tree has made a contract with a highly specialized red ant. The tree has evolved giant spores which act as housing for the ants In return for shelter, the ants supply defense. When a giraffe starts to eat the tree's leaves, the shaking branch acts like an alarm. The ants charge out and secrete an acid onto the giraffe's tongue. The giraffe learns its lesson and never returns. Without each other, the tree would be picked dry and the ants would have no shade from the brutal African sun Both would die. But with each other, they succeed, they survive, they surpass. They have different aims, different goals but they work together. Max, we would like to establish a mutually benefiting alliance with you.</p>
<p>I'm not interested.</p>

<p>Excellent.</p>
<p>Do you have the Torah in digital form?</p>
<p>Thursday, September fourth, sixteen forty-five. The alchemist awakes. All of my ideas, work and dreams are spinning together It all has to do with spirals. It began with spirals and the answers are thee.</p>
<p>The most I can remember about their significance is from Schneider's class. That bullshit core for majors. Schneider's fascination with mystical geometry made him a bit of a quack...but...then again, look at Kepler. He was really into Pythagoras. The leader of an ancient sect which believed the entire universe could be represented by numbers. Pythagoras' greatest contribution was the golden ratio, which ended up influencing art and science for thousands of years, arguably all the way up to today.</p>
<p>The golden ratio, if I recall, is this unique relationship between the length and width of a special rectangle called the golden rectangle.</p>
<p>carefully measuring out a golden rectangle. The rectangle fits perfectly over Leonardo Da Vinci's Man.</p>
<p>If you take the width of this rectangle and use it to form a square within the rectangle, the part left over is a rectangle that has the same ratio as the original rectangle. au can continue squaring the rectangle, over and over again, making the rectangles smaller and smaller to infinity.</p>
<p>squaring rectangle after rectangle. Then he draws the golden spiral through the rectangles.</p>
<p>Then, if you connect a curve through these rectangles you get the golden spiral. The Pythagoreans loved this shape because they found it everywhere in nature.</p>

<p>Hey, I'm the last guy to want to talk about school at the bar. But as long as you're here I want to "seize" the opportunity to ask you a question.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm sure you covered it in your history class.</p>
<p>To tell you the truth, I wasn't there much. The class was rather elementary.</p>
<p>Elementary? Oh, I don't doubt that it was. I remember the class, it was just between recess and lunch.</p>
<p>All right, are we gonna have a problem?</p>
<p>There's no problem. I was just hoping you could give me some insight into the evolution of the market economy in the early colonies. My contention is that prior to the Revolutionary War the economic modalities especially of the southern colonies could most aptly be characterized as agrarian precapitalist and...</p>
<p>Of course that's your contention. You're a first year grad student. You just finished some Marxian historian, Pete Garrison prob'ly, and so naturally that's what you believe until next month when you get to James Lemon and get convinced that Virginia and Pennsylvania were strongly entrepreneurial and capitalist back in 1740. That'll last until sometime in your second year, then you'll be in here regurgitating Gordon Wood about the Pre-revolutionary utopia and the capital-forming effects of military mobilization.</p>
<p>Well, as a matter of fact, I won't, because Wood drastically underestimates the impact of--</p>
<p>"Wood drastically underestimates the impact of social distinctions predicated upon wealth, especially inherited wealth..." You got that from "Work in Essex County," Page 421, right? Do you have any thoughts of your own on the subject or were you just gonna plagiarize the whole book for me?</p>
<p>Look, don't try to pass yourself off as some kind of an intellect at the expense of my friend just to impress these girls.</p>
<p>The sad thing is, in about 50 years you might start doin' some thinkin' on your own and by then you'll realize there are only two certainties in life.</p>

<p>Which one's your building?</p>
<p>Building two.</p>
<p>Look, he got his job through his P.O. so you can call him.</p>
<p>There is a lengthy legal precedent, Your Honor, going back to 1789, whereby a defendant may claim self- defense against an agent of the government where the act is shown to be a defense against tyranny, a defense of liberty--</p>
<p>Mr. Simmons, Officer McNeely who signed the complaint isn't in my courtroom. Why is that?</p>
<p>He's in the hospital with a broken knee, Your Honor. But I have depositions from the other officers.</p>
<p>Henry Ward Beecher proclaimed, in his Proverbs From Plymouth Pulpit back in 1887, that "Every American citizen is by birth, a sworn officer of the state. Every man is a policeman." As for the other officers, even William Congrave said; "he that first cries out 'stop thief' is 'oft he that has stolen the treasure."</p>
<p>Your Honor--</p>
<p>I am afforded the right to speak in my own defense by our constitution, Sir. The same document which guarantees my right to liberty. "Liberty," in case you've forgotten, is "the soul's right to breathe, and when it cannot take a long breath laws are girded too tight. Without liberty, man is a syncope."   (beat, to Judge) Ibid.

<p>No, that's okay. It's an important question. 'Cause you'll have your bad times, which wake you up to the good stuff you weren't paying attention to. And you can fail, as long as you're trying hard. But there's nothing worse than regret.</p>

<p>Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will, but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her.</p>
<p>When did you know she was the one?</p>
<p>October 21, 1975. Game six of the World Series. Biggest game in Red Sox history, Me and my friends slept out on the sidewalk all night to get tickets. We were sitting in a bar waiting for the game to start and in walks this girl. What a game that was. Tie game in the bottom of the tenth inning, in steps Carlton Fisk, hit a long fly ball down the left field line. Thirty-five thousand fans on their feet, screamin' at the ball to stay fair. Fisk is runnin' up the baseline, wavin' at the ball like a madman. It hits the foul pole, home run. Thirty-five thousand people went crazy. And I wasn't one of them.</p>
<p>Where were you?</p>
<p>I was havin' a drink with my future wife.</p>
<p>You missed Pudge Fisk's homerun to have a drink with a woman you had never met?</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>So wait a minute. The Red Sox haven't won a World Series since nineteen eighteen, you slept out for tickets, games gonna start in twenty minutes, in walks a girl you never seen before, and you give your ticket away?</p>

<p>Gerry says the meeting went well.</p>
<p>I guess.</p>
<p>What did you think?</p>
<p>What did I think?</p>
<p>Say I'm working at N.S.A. Somebody puts a code on my desk, something nobody else can break. So I take a shot at it and maybe I break it. And I'm real happy with myself, 'cause I did my job well. But maybe that code was the location of some rebel army in North Africa or the Middle East. Once they have that location, they bomb the village where the rebels were hiding and fifteen hundred people I never had a problem with get killed. (rapid fire) Now the politicians are sayin' "send in the Marines to secure the area" 'cause they don't give a shit. It won't be their kid over there, gettin' shot. Just like it wasn't them when their number got called, 'cause they were pullin' a tour in the National Guard. It'll be some guy from Southie takin' shrapnel in the ass. And he comes home to find that the plant he used to work at got exported to the country he just got back from. And the guy who put the shrapnel in his ass got his old job, 'cause he'll work for fifteen cents a day and no bathroom breaks. Meanwhile my buddy from Southie realizes the only reason he was over there was so we could install a government that would sell us oil at a good price. And of course the oil companies used the skirmish to scare up oil prices so they could turn a quick buck. A cute, little ancillary benefit for them but it ain't helping my buddy at two-fifty a gallon. And naturally they're takin' their sweet time bringin' the oil back and maybe even took the liberty of hiring an alcoholic skipper who likes to drink seven and sevens and play slalom with the icebergs and it ain't too long 'til he hits one, spills the oil, and kills all the sea-life in the North Atlantic. So my buddy's out of work and he can't afford to drive so he's got to walk to the job interviews which sucks 'cause the shrapnel in his ass is givin' him chronic hemorrhoids. And meanwhile he's starvin' 'cause every time he tries to get a bite to eat the only blue-plate special they're servin' is North Atlantic scrod with Quaker State.</p>
<p>So what'd I think? I'm holdin' out for somethin' better. I figure I'll eliminate the middle man. Why not just shoot my buddy, take his job and give it to his sworn enemy, hike up gas prices, bomb a village, club a baby seal, hit the hash pipe and join the National Guard? Christ, I could be elected President.</p>

<p>Something's going on, and it has to do with that number. The answer is there.</p>

<p>No. it's a pattern. A pattern is in that number</p>

<p>Listen to me. The Ancient Japanese considered the Go board to be a microcosm of the universe. Although when it is empty it appears to be simple and ordered, in fact, the possibilities of game play are endless. They say that no two Go games have ever been alike. Just like snowflakes. So, the Go board actually represents an extremely complex and chaotic universe. That is the truth of our world, Max. It can't be easily summed up with math. There is no simple pattern.</p>
<p>But as a Go game progresses, the possibilities become smaller and smaller. The board does take on order. Soon, all moves are predictable.</p>
<p>So?</p>
<p>So, maybe, even though we're not sophisticated enough to be aware of it, there is an underlying order...a pattern, beneath every Go game. Maybe that pattern is like the pattern in the market, in the Torah. The two sixteen number.</p>
<p>That is insanity, Max.</p>

<p>Good. It's funny, even though we have different aims and different goals we're actually incredibly alike. We both seek the same thing—perfection. I know... clearly we're seeking different types of perfection, but that is what makes us perfect candidates for a fruitful partnership. If you let me, I can be your greatest ally. Take the acacia tree...in East Africa. It is the most prevalent plant in all of Kenya because it has managed to secure its niche by defeating its major predator, the giraffe. To accomplish this, the tree has made a contract with a highly specialized red ant. The tree has evolved giant spores which act as housing for the ants In return for shelter, the ants supply defense. When a giraffe starts to eat the tree's leaves, the shaking branch acts like an alarm. The ants charge out and secrete an acid onto the giraffe's tongue. The giraffe learns its lesson and never returns. Without each other, the tree would be picked dry and the ants would have no shade from the brutal African sun Both would die. But with each other, they succeed, they survive, they surpass. They have different aims, different goals but they work together. Max, we would like to establish a mutually benefiting alliance with you.</p>

<p>The Romans also murdered all of our priest-hood—the Cohanim—the Cohens, and with their deaths they destroyed our greatest secret. In the center of the great temple was the holy of holies which was the heart of Jewish life. This was the earthly residence for our God. The one God. It contained the ark of the Tabernacle which stored the original Ten Commandments that God gave to Moses. Only one man could enter this space once a year on the holiest day of the year, Yom Kippur On the Day of Atonement, all of Israel would descend upon Jerusalem to witness the High Cohen's trip into the holy of holies. If the holy man was pure he would reemerge a few moments later and Israel was secured a prosperous year. It meant that we were one yea r closer to the messianic age. Closer to the return of the Garden of Eden. But if he was impure, he would die instantly and it meant that we were doomed. The High Cohen had a single ritual to perform in the holy of holies. He had to intone a single word.</p>

<p>I also know that anyone who disputes the verdict of an inquisitor is guilty of heresy. </p>
<p>I, too, was an inquisitor, but in the early days, when the Inquisition strove to guide, not to punish. And once I had to preside at the trial of a man... whose only crime was to have translated a Greek book that conflicted with the holy scriptures. Bernardo Gui wanted to condemn him as heretic. I acquitted the man. Then Gui accused me of heresy for having defended him. I appealed to the pope. I was put in prison... tortured... and I recanted. </p>
<p>And I'm still alive. </p>

<p>the girl or for myself? I did not know. With the dawn, came the envoys of the pope: our adversaries in the forthcoming debate. But it meant so little to me now. </p>
<p>at last we meet for this long-awaited debate. We have all journeyed great distances in order to put an end to the dispute that has so gravely impaired the unity of our Holy Mother Church. Good people throughout Christendom are directing their gazes at these venerable walls anxiously awaiting our answer to the vexed question: "Did Christ, or did He not, own the clothes that He wore?" </p>
<p>Our Holy Father, the pope, has authorized me and these, his faithful servants, to speak on his behalf. The question is not whether Christ was poor... but whether the Church should be poor! You Franciscans wish to see the clergy renounce its possessions... and surrender its richness... the abbeys dissipate their sacred treasures and hand over their fertile acres to the serfs.</p>

Soon his eyesight fails, his lips shrivel... and his face becomes covered with pustules and scabs."

<p>let the flames purify each of us in his own heart. Let us return to what was and ever should be the office of this abbey. The preservation of knowledge. "Preservation," I say, not "search for." Because there is no progress in the history of knowledge... merely a continuous and sublime recapitulation. Let us now praise the Almighty that the bloody-eyed and cloven-hoofed Antichrist has been purged from our sacred precincts and our monastery has returned to peace. </p>

That'll last until sometime in your second year, then you'll be in here regurgitating Gordon Wood about the Pre-revolutionary utopia and the capital-forming effects of military mobilization.</p>

<p>Look, don't try to pass yourself off as some kind of an intellect at the expense of my friend just to impress these girls.</p>
<p>The sad thing is, in about 50 years you might start doin' some thinkin' on your own and by then you'll realize there are only two certainties in life.</p>

<p>What? Do I wonder if I'd be better off if I never met my wife?</p>
<p>No, that's okay. It's an important question. 'Cause you'll have your bad times, which wake you up to the good stuff you weren't paying attention to. And you can fail, as long as you're trying hard. But there's nothing worse than regret.</p>
<p>You don't regret meetin' your wife?</p>
<p>Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will, but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her.</p>
<p>When did you know she was the one?</p>
<p>October 21, 1975. Game six of the World Series. Biggest game in Red Sox history, Me and my friends slept out on the sidewalk all night to get tickets. We were sitting in a bar waiting for the game to start and in walks this girl. What a game that was. Tie game in the bottom of the tenth inning, in steps Carlton Fisk, hit a long fly ball down the left field line. Thirty-five thousand fans on their feet, screamin' at the ball to stay fair. Fisk is runnin' up the baseline, wavin' at the ball like a madman. It hits the foul pole, home run. Thirty-five thousand people went crazy. And I wasn't one of them.</p>
<p>Where were you?</p>
<p>I was havin' a drink with my future wife.</p>
<p>You missed Pudge Fisk's homerun to have a drink with a woman you had never met?</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>So wait a minute. The Red Sox haven't won a World Series since nineteen eighteen, you slept out for tickets, games gonna start in twenty minutes, in walks a girl you never seen before, and you give your ticket away?</p>

But, my lord abbot, he is innocent of the crimes that have bathed your abbey in blood. For brother Remigio cannot read Greek. And this entire mystery hinges on the theft and possession of a book written in Greek and hidden in some secret part of the library. </p>
