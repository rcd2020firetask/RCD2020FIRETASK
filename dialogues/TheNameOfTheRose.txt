ADSO (V.O.) 

Having reached the end of my poor sinner's life... my 

hair now white... I prepare to leave on this parchment 

my testimony as to the wondrous and terrible events 

I witnessed in my youth... towards the end of the year 

of Our Lord, 1327. 

May God grant me the wisdom and grace to be the faithful 

chronicler of the happenings that took place in a remote 

abbey in the dark north of Italy: an abbey whose name it 

seems even now pious and prudent to omit. 

(William and Adso arrive at the abbey) 

ADSO (V.O.):

to relive the past and revive the feelings 

of uneasiness that oppressed my heart as 

we entered the battlements. 

INT. 

ABBOT:

MALACHIA:

MALACHIA:

of investigating such matters. 

... The holy Inquisition. 

ABBOT:

Jorge:

WILLIAM:

Adso:

WILLIAM:

first learn to obey it. Hmm? 

So, return to the forecourt, get the 

edificium on your left... enter the 

quadrangle on you right, you'll find

the place you need. Behind the third 

arch. 

Adso:

this abbey. 

WILLIAM:

for the spot in some haste. 

I noticed, however, that he emerged more 

slowly with an air of contentment. 

ADSO:

WILLIAM:

ABBOT:

honored to welcome you and your Franciscan 

brothers to our abbey. 

WILLIAM:

ABBOT:

weeks. The others are due tomorrow. 

You must be very tired after your long 

journey. 

WILLIAM:

ABBOT:

WILLIAM:

ABBOT:

WILLIAM:

has recently been gathered unto God. 

ABBOT:

Brother Adelmo was one of our finest 

illuminators. 

WILLIAM:

Page 3/48



ABBOT:

WILLIAM:

His humor and comic images were almost 

infamous. But he was said to be a young 

man. 

ABBOT:

WILLIAM:

ABBOT:

Well, that is, I... 

(looks around and closes the door) 

Brother William... may I speak to you 

candidly? 

WILLIAM:

ABBOT:

I thought it was an answer to my prayers. 

"Here," I said, "is a man who has knowledge, 

both of the human spirit and of the wiles 

of the evil one." 

The fact is, Brother Adelmo's death has 

caused much spiritual unease upon my flock. 

WILLIAM:

of the Baron of Melk. 

Please, do continue. 

ABBOT:

horribly mutilated, dashed against a rock 

at the foot of the tower... under a window, 

which was... How shall I say this? 

which was... 

WILLIAM:

ABBOT:

WILLIAM:

spoken of spiritual unease. You would have 

concluded that he'd fallen.

ABBOT:

opened... nor was the glass shattered... 

nor is there any access to the roof above. 

WILLIAM:

natural explanation, your monks suspect 

the presence of a supernatural force within 

these walls. 

ABBOT:

man such as you, Brother Wiliam. Acute in 

uncovering and prudent, if necessary, in... 

covering up before the papal delegates 

arrive. 

WILLIAM:

in such matters. 

ABBOT:

my dilemma, but... unless I can put the 

minds of my flock at rest, I will have 

no alternative but to summon the help of 

the Inquisition. 

EXT. 

WILLIAM:

INT. 

(a man is lying on the floor) 

WILLIAM:

great spiritual leaders of our order. 

Come. 

WILLIAM:

others would have him burnt as a heretic. 

His book on the poverty of the clergy is 

not favored reading in the papal palaces. 

So, now he lives in hiding like an outlaw. 

UBERTINO:

place at once. The devil is roaming this 

abbey. 

Page 5/48



WILLIAM:

Baskerville. 

UBERTINO:

William, my son... forgive me. 

We had lost trace of you for so long. 

WILLIAM:

UBERTINO:

to our Virgin for a miracle. 

WILLIAM:

response. 

This is my young novice, Adso of Melk. 

His father has entrusted me with his 

education and welfare. 

UBERTINO:

Have you not heard, the devil is hurling 

beautiful boys out of windows? 

There was something feminine... 

something diabolical about the young 

one who died. He had the eyes of a girl 

seeking intercourse with the devil. 

Beware of this place. The beast is still 

among us. I can sense him now, here... 

within these very walls. I'm afraid, 

William... for you, for me... for the 

outcome of this debate. 

Oh, my son. The times we live in. But 

let us not frighten our young friend. 

(looks up at the Blessed Mary) 

She's beautiful, is she not? 

When the female... by nature, so perverse... 

becomes sublime by holiness, then she can 

be the noblest vehicle of grace. 

(says in Latin) 

"Beautiful are the breasts that protrude 

but a little."

EXT. 

ADSO:

Page 6/48



WILLIAM:

Come. 

Adso, we must not allow ourselves to be 

influenced by irrational rumors of the 

Antichrist. Let us instead exercise our 

brains and try to solve this tantalising 

conundrum. 

(peasants bring the tithe) 

MONK:

shalt you receive an hundred-fold in 

paradise." 

ADSO (V.O):

philosophers and the faculties of his own 

remarkable, logical intelligence. 

Unhappily, my fears were not mere phantoms 

of my youthful imagination. 

(the two come to the tower) 

WILLIAM:

illuminator. 

WILLIAM:

to the poor. 

Now, what if it wasn't that tower that he 

fell from but somewhere over there, and 

the body rolled all the way down here? 

Adso? No devil needed anymore. 

(a stone rolls down) 

WILLIAM:

No devil needed 

(Adso sees a peasant girl) 

WILLIAM:

That's where he fell from. He jumped. 

Adso, are you paying attention? 

ADSO:

Jumped? You mean that he committed 

suicide? 

WILLIAM:

Page 7/48



at night in the middle of a hailstorm? 

Certainly not to admire the landscape. 

ADSO:

him. 

WILLIAM:

with the body? 

Easier to get rid of it through that sluice

gate they pour charity through. 

WILLIAM:

Suicide? 

ADSO:

abandoned by God? 

WILLIAM:

would have felt at home? 

INT. ABBEY. DINING ROOM 

ABBOT:

no grounds for suspecting the presence of 

an evil spirit among us... either of this 

world or another. 

We praise our Lord that the debate which 

we are so greatly honored to host... may 

now proceed without a shadow of fear. 

We also praise the Almighty for sending us 

Brother William of Baskerville... whose 

experience in previous duties, although 

onerous to him, has been of such service 

to us here. 

May serenity and spiritual peace reign 

once more in our hearts. 

MONK:

"A monk should keep silent. 

He should not speak his thoughts... 

until he is questioned. 

A monk should not laugh. 

For it is the fool alone... who 

lifts up his voice in laughter." 

INT. NIGHT.

Were you not always a monk?

against nature. And they were not of the 

latter disposition.... if you ascertain my 

meaning. 

INT. 

(Adso is looking up many grotesque carvings in 

stone) 

SALVATORE:

Watch out for the 'dracul' who cometh 'in 

futurum' to gnaw on your anima! 

Death is supreme. 

You contemplate the apocalypse? 

There, we have the devil. 

Ugly 'con' Salvatore, eh? 

My little brother, 'penitenziagite.' 

WILLIAM:

SALVATORE:

WILLIAM:

SALVATORE:

I don't have a good rhetoric. But men

You see, Adso... the step between ecstatic 

vision and sinful frenzy... is all too brief. 

ADSO:

WILLIAM:

were more to the taste of the Dolcinites. 

Hardly a specialist of Aristotle. But, 

yes, you're right. We must keep an open 

mind. 

We are very fortunate to have such snowy 

ground here. It's often the parchment on 

which the criminal unwillingly writes his 

autograph. 

Page 12/48



Now, what do you read from these footprints 

here? 

ADSO:

WILLIAM:

WILLIAM:

the weight of another man. 

Let us commit the autograph of this sole 

to our memory. 

ADSO:

in this direction. 

WILLIAM:

the possibility that the man was walking 

backwards, dragging the body thus... 

Hence, the furrows created by the heels. 

Now, where did the erudite Greek translator 

meet the anonymous author of his death? 

INT. SCRIPTORIUM. 

(the librarian hastily closes a door) 

WILLIAM:

Perhaps you will permit us to examine the 

work of the two unfortunates... that were 

so distressingly gathered unto God. 

Your request is most unusual. 

WILLIAM:

MALACHIA:

WILLIAM:

(takes out his magnifying glasses) 

Page 13/48



MONK:

WILLIAM:

A donkey teaching the scriptures to the 

bishops. The pope is a fox. The abbot 

is a monkey. He really had a daring talent 

for comic images. 

BERENGAR:

MONKS:

JORGE:

"A monk should not laugh. Only fool lifts 

up his voice in laughter." 

I trust my words didn't offend you, Brother 

William... but I heard the persons laughing 

at laughable things. You Franciscans, 

however, belong to an order where merriment 

is viewed with indulgence. 

WILLIAM:

disposed to laughter. 

JORGE:

look like monkeys.

WILLIAM:

Laughter is particular to man. 

JORGE:

JORGE:

that He did. 

WILLIAM:

say that He did not. Even the saints have 

been known to employ comedy to ridicule 

the enemies of the faith. 

For example, when the pagans plunged St. 

Maurus into the boiling water, he complained 

Page 14/48



that his bath was too cold. The Sultan put 

his hand in, scalded it. 

JORGE:

sorrow with idle banter! 

WILLIAM:

My remarks were truly out of place. 

WILLIAM:

Which was the Greek translator's desk? 

MONK:

WILLIAM:

EXT. 

WILLIAM:

that visit? 

ADSO:

WILLIAM:

were on the scryptorium shelves? All 

Page 15/48



those scriveners, copyists, translators, 

researchers, thinkers... But where are 

the multitude of books that they need for 

their work? And for which this abbey is 

famed. Where are the books? 

ADSO:

WILLIAM:

ADSO:

that whenever you ask me a question, you 

already have the answer. Do you know 

where the books are? 

WILLIAM:

But I'll wager my faith that that tower 

contains something other than air. 

ADSO:

closed as we came in? 

WILLIAM:

ADSO:

(something falls onto them) 

WILLIAM:

ADSO:

Master! Master, quick! I have him! 

WILLIAM:

ADSO:

REMIGIO:

(to William) Please, don't talk to the 

abbot about his past. He's innocent of 

the deaths in this abbey. I swear it. 

WILLIAM:

is some information. 

Page 16/48



ADSO (V.O.):

quickly dismissed my suspicions of the 

heretical hunchback... and why it was so 

urgent that we visit the tower. I assumed 

he could not resist the temptation to 

penetrate the library and look at the 

books. 

INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT 

(The assistant librarian, who is reading 

a book all alone, puts out a candle) 

WILLIAM:

ADSO:

WILLIAM:

entrance. 

Let's see what the moon-faced assistant 

librarian was trying to conceal from us 

this morning, shall we? 

(finds a note) 

Tiny Greek letters, perhaps written by 

an ant with inky feet. 

"Use vulgar people take pleasure from 

their defects... " 

(brings the note to a candle) 

Ah, yes. Written with lemon juice. 

"Sagittarius... Sun... Mercury... 

Scorpion." It's some zodiacal code 

giving directions, but to where? 

(clanks) 

Who's there? 

Hey! Who's there? 

Who's there? 

(somwone taking the book, flees) 

WILLIAM:

They were on that book. 

EXT. NIGHT 

WILLIAM:

(to light his lantern, Adso enters the kitchen) 

Page 17/48



REMIGIO:

I know you are here. I can smell you. 

What's the matter with you, huh? 

Are you afraid of me? 

(a girl is hiding) 

I'll find you. 

(the girl seduces Adso) 

ADSO (V.O.):

Who was this creature that rose like the 

dawn... was bewitching as the moon, radiant 

as the sun... terrible as an army poised 

for battle? 

WILLIAM:

This is where you catch them? 

SALVATORE:

Bigger, eh? 

WILLIAM:

SALVATORE:

WILLIAM:

SALVATORE:

So Adelmo gave the parchment to Berengar?

INT. KITCHEN 

Page 18/48



ADSO:

Master! In here, quick! 

I found another one. 

WILLIAM:

Have you ever met anyone with a rib cage 

large enough to accommodate a heart of 

those dimensions? 

ADSO:

WILLIAM:

One of the monks probably gave it to that 

peasant girl in exchange for her favors. 

ADSO:

WILLIAM:

He must have been a very ugly monk. 

ADSO. Why ugly? 

WILLIAM:

would no doubt have blessed him with her 

carnal favors for nothing. 

In any event, whatever happened in this 

dreadful kitchen has no bearing on our 

investigations. 

The hunchback convinced me that Brother 

Berengar, the assistant librarian, is the 

key to the whole enigma. 

What did you say? 

ADSO:

WILLIAM:

INT. NIGHT 

ADSO:

There's something I must tell you.

ADSO:

WILLIAM:

of a man's precious soul." 

While Ecclesiastics tells us, "More bitter 

than death is woman." 

ADSO:

WILLIAM:

of your experience. But I find it difficult 

to convince myself... that God would have 

introduced such a foul being into creation... 

without endowing her with some virtues. Hm? 

How peaceful life would be without love, 

Adso. How safe. How tranquil. .. and how 

dull. 

EXT. DAY 

DELEGATES:

our steps to this refuge of spiritual 

peace because you wish for reconciliation 

as much as we Franciscans. 

Let us go, brothers. 

Thy will be done, oh Lord. 

Amen. 

Amen. 

WILLIAM:

He's probably hiding somewhere with the 

book and my magnifying glasses.

SEVERINUS:

WILLIAM:

He did not write with his tongue, I 

presume. 

INT. 

ABBOT:

WILLIAM:

Some random notes from the book he was 

reading just before he died. Do you see 

how the calligraphy changes? From this 

point on, he was dying. And what, my lord, 

do you conclude from that? 

ABBOT:

Page 24/48



WILLIAM:

by your finest illuminator, Brother Adelmo 

who possessed this parchment before 

Venantius. 

(cont'd) And how do we know that? 

Because those random notes overrun Adelmo's 

blue smudge, and not vice-versa. 

ABBOT:

in a terrifying mystery. Yet, I detect 

nothing, in your obscure dissertation... 

that sheds any light upon it. 

WILLIAM:

Someone was at great pains to conceal a 

secret of the first magnitude. 

Now, the calligraphy is, without question, 

left-handed. And the only left-handed member 

of your community is... or rather was... 

Brother Berengar, the assistant librarian. 

Now, what kind of secret knowledge would he 

have been privy to? 

ABBOT:

tell me. 

WILLIAM:

dangerous books. 

(cont'd) Everyone here knew of the assistant 

librarian's passion for handsome boys. 

When the beautiful Adelmo wanted to read 

such a forbidden book, Berengar offered 

him the key to its whereabouts... 

enciphered on that parchment in exchange 

for unnatural caresses. 

ABBOT:

WILLIAM:

Berengar's lustful advances. But 

afterwards, wracked by remorse, he 

wandered weeping and desperate in the 

graveyard, where he met the Greek 

Page 25/48



translator. 

ABBOT:

WILLIAM:

who saw Adelmo giving this parchment to 

Venantius... then running towards the 

small tower and hurling himself out of 

the window. 

(cont'd) The night of my arrival, while Berengar 

punished his sinful flesh... Venantius, 

helped by the coded instructions on the

parchment made his way into the forbidden 

library and found the book. He took it 

back to his desk in the scriptorium and 

began to read it. After scribbling down 

those mysterious quotations he died with 

a black stain on his finger. 

(cont'd) The assistant librarian discovered the 

body and dragged it down to the pigpens 

to avert suspicion falling on him. But 

he left his autograph behind. The book 

remained on the translator's desk. 

Berengar returned there last night and 

read it. Soon after, overcome by some 

agonizing pain, he tried to take a soothing 

bath with lime leaves and drowned. He, 

too, had a blackened finger. 

(cont'd) All three died because of a book which 

kills... or for which men will kill. 

I therefore urge you to grant me access 

to the library. 

JORGE:

By idolizing reason you failed to see what 

is obvious to everyone in this abbey. 

MALACHIA:

The papal delegation's arrived. Bernardo 

Gui. 

ABBOT:

We are mindful of your efforts but I 

should now ask you to refrain from further 

Page 26/48



investigations. 

(burns the parchment) 

(cont'd) Happily, there will be someone arriving with 

the papal delegation who is well-versed in 

the wiles of the evil one. A man, I believe, 

you know only too well. Bernardo Gui... of 

the Inquisition.

ADSO (V.O.):

that our union had given me... but my soul 

could not forget her. 

And now, now that I saw her in the midst of 

her poverty and squalor, I praised God in 

my heart that I was a Franciscan. 

I wanted her to know that I did not belong 

to this rapacious abbey but to an order 

dedicated to lifting her people out of 

their physical destitution, and spiritual 

depravation. 

Ubertino:

You are mad and arrogant... but I love you 

and shall never cease to pray for you. 

(to Adso) Goodbye, dear child. 

Try not to learn too many bad examples 

from your master. 

He thinks too much. Relying always on 

the deductions of his head... instead of 

trusting in the prophetic capacities... 

of his heart. Learn to mortify your 

intelligence. Weep over the wounds of 

our Lord! 

Oh, and do throw away those books!

Those are the foundations of the tower. 

But how to reach the library?

The rats love parchment even more than 

scholars do. Let's follow him. 

166. Bolted scriptorium door. 

167, 168, 169, 170. 

... 317, 318.... 

I knew it. Adso! I knew it! 

Adso, do you realize... we're in one of 

the greatest libraries in the whole of 

Christendom? Wow! 

ADSO:

looking for? 

WILLIAM:

ADSO:

WILLIAM:

And this is the version annotated by 

Umberto de Bologna. 

How many more rooms, huh? How many 

more books? 

No one should be forbidden to consult 

these books freely. 

ADSO:

precious, too fragile. 

WILLIAM:

It's because they often contain a wisdom 

different from ours... and ideas that could 

encourage us to doubt the infallibility of 

the word of God.

You see, Adso, that is the charm of a

Open a book... and read it aloud. 

Leave the room you're in... and keep 

turning left. 

ADSO:

"Love does not originate as an illness 

but is transformed into it when it becomes 

obsessive thoughts." 

"The Muslim theologian Ahmed Hasim states 

that the lovesick person does not want to 

be healed and his dreams cause irregular 

breathing and quicken the pulse." 

"He identifies amorous melancholia with 

lycanthropy, a disease that induces 

wolf-like behavior in its victims." 

"The lover's outer appearance begins to 

Page 30/48



change. Soon his eyesight fails, his lips 

shrivel... and his face becomes covered 

with pustules and scabs." 

"Marks resembling the bites of a dog appear

I, too, was an inquisitor, but in the 

early days, when the Inquisition strove 

to guide, not to punish. 

And once I had to preside at the trial 

of a man... whose only crime was to have 

translated a Greek book that conflicted 

with the holy scriptures. 

Bernardo Gui wanted to condemn him as 

heretic. I acquitted the man. Then Gui 

accused me of heresy for having defended 

him. I appealed to the pope. 

I was put in prison... tortured...

and I recanted.

our adversaries in the forthcoming debate.

But it meant so little to me now. 

DEBATE - DAY 

MICHELE:

at last we meet for this long-awaited 

debate. We have all journeyed great 

distances in order to put an end to the 

dispute that has so gravely impaired the 

unity of our Holy Mother Church. 

Good people throughout Christendom are 

directing their gazes at these venerable 

walls anxiously awaiting our answer to 

the vexed question: 

"Did Christ, or did He not, own the clothes 

that He wore?" 

ENVOY:

Our Holy Father, the pope, has authorized 

me and these, his faithful servants, to 

speak on his behalf. 

The question is not whether Christ was 

poor... but whether the Church should be

poor! 

You Franciscans wish to see the clergy 

renounce its possessions... and surrender 

its richness... the abbeys dissipate 

their sacred treasures and hand over 

their fertile acres to the serfs. 

SEVERINUS:

I found the book. 

I found it in the dispensary. 

A book in Greek was behind one of my jars. 

WILLIAM:

Return, lock yourself inside. 

I'll be there just as soon as I can. 

ENVOY:

and wage war on the infidel.

INT. INQUISITION 

BERNARD:

by their vow of obedience and, on pain 

of excommunication... to aid the inquisitor 

in his painful struggle against heresy. 

To sit with me on this tribunal... and 

to share the burden of the verdict... 

I will require the counsel of two fellow 

judges. 

My lord Abbot... and... Brother William 

of Baskerville. 

(Salvatore, Remigio and the peasant girl are 

brought before the court)

BERNARDO:

Salvatore, will you repeat your confession 

of last night? That you and your accomplice, 

Remigio de Varagine... were members of the 

heretical Dolcinites? 

Page 38/48



SALVATORE:

BERNARDO:

SALVATORE:

BERNARDO:

Remigio de Varagine, do you deny the 

confession of your accomplice? 

REMIGIO:

For the twelve years I lived here... 

I did nothing but stuff my belly... 

shag my wick... and squeeze the hungry 

peasants for tithes. 

But now you have given me the strength 

to remember what I once believed in with 

all my heart, and for that I thank you.

but I beg of you to not let her suffer for 

my wrongdoing. 

Blessed Mother, many years ago you granted 

a miracle by saving my master. Will you 

not do the same for this girl? 

My master says that the simple folk always 

pay for all. But, please, Holy Mother, 

do not let it be so.

Guilty is Salvatore... who has confessed 

to his heretical past and was caught in 

flagrante delicto with a witch!

Guilty is Remigio de Varagine... who, 

in addition to unrepentant of his former 

heresies, was caught attempting to escape 

after murdering Severinus.

ABBOT:

sentence of the Holy Inquisition. 

BERNARDO:

WILLIAM:

in his youth misinterpreted the message 

of the Ggspels. And he is guilty of 

having confused the love of poverty with 

the blind destruction of wealth and property. 

But, my lord abbot, he is innocent of 

the crimes that have bathed your abbey in 

blood. For brother Remigio cannot read 

Greek. And this entire mystery hinges on 

the theft and possession of a book written 

in Greek and hidden in some secret part 

of the library. 

BERNARDO:

obliged to extract the prisoner's confession 

to murder. 

Take him to the forge and show him the

Brother William's outburst. 

ENVOY:

The debate is concluded. 

MICHELE:

BERNARDO:

he was formerly purged. Having sought

JORGE:

let the flames purify each of us in his 

own heart. 

Let us return to what was and ever should 

be the office of this abbey. The 

preservation of knowledge. "Preservation," 

I say, not "search for." Because there is 

no progress in the history of knowledge... 

merely a continuous and sublime 

recapitulation. 

Let us now praise the Almighty that the 

bloody-eyed and cloven-hoofed Antichrist 

has been purged from our sacred precincts 

and our monastery has returned to peace.

for I learned from my master much that 

was wise and good and true. 

When at last we parted company, he 

presented me with his eyeglasses. 

I was still young, he said, but someday 

they would serve me well. And, in fact, 

I am wearing them now on my nose as I 

write these lines. 

Then he embraced fondly, like a father, 

and sent me on my way. I never saw him 

again, and know not what became of him... 

but I pray always that God received his 

soul and forgave the many little vanities 

to which he was driven by his intellectual 

pride. 

And yet, now that I am an old, old man, 

I must confess that of all the faces that 

appear to me out of the past... the one I 

see most clearly is that of the girl... 

of whom I've never ceased to dream these 

many long years.
