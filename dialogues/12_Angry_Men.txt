CHARACTERS:

FOREMAN:

has and handles himself quite 

formally. Not overly bright, but dogged.

JUROR NO. 2:

any opinions of his own. Easily swayed 

and usually adopts the opinion of the last person to whom he has spoken.

JUROR NO. 3:

within whom can be detected a streak 

of sadism. He is a humorless man who is intolerant of opinions other than

his own and accustomed to forcing 

his wishes and views upon others.

JUROR NO. 4:

practiced speaker who presents himself well 

at all times. He seems to feel a little bit above the rest of the jurors.

His only concern is with the facts in this 

case, and he is appalled at the behavior of the others.

JUROR NO. 5:

obligations in this case very seriously but, 

who finds it difficult to speak up when his elders have the floor.

JUROR NO. 6:

decisions slowly and carefully. A man who 

finds it difficult to create positive opinions, but who must listen to and

digest and accept those opinions offered 

by others which appeal to him most.

JUROR NO. 7:

important things to do than to sit on a jury. 

He is quick to show temper, quick to form opinions on things about which he

knows nothing. Is a bully and, of 

course, a coward.

JUROR NO. 8:

sides of every question and constantly 

seeks the truth. A man of strength tempered with compassion. Above all, he

is a man who wants justice to be 

done and will fight to see that it is.

Page 2/44



JUROR NO. 9:

now merely waiting to die. A man who 

recognizes himself for what he is and mourns the days when it would have

been possible to be courageous 

without shielding himself behind his many years.

JUROR NO. 10 An angry, bitter man. He is man who antagonizes almost at

sight. A bigot who places no 

values on any human life save his own, a man who has been nowhere and is

going nowhere and knows it deep 

within him.

JUROR NO. 11:

1941. A man who speaks with an 

accent and who is ashamed humble, almost subservient to the people around

him, but who will honestly seek 

justice because he has suffered through so much injustice.

Juror NO. 12:

beings in terms of percentages graphs, and 

polls and has no real understanding of people. He is a superficial snob,

but trying to be a good fellow. 

NO. 12:

in terms of percentages graphs, and 

polls and has no real understanding of people. He is a superficial snob,

but trying to be a good fellow.

ACT 1

Fade in on a jury box. Twelve men are seated in it, listening intently to

the voice of the judge as he charges 

them. We do not see the judge. He speaks in slow, measured tones, and his

voice is grave. The camera drifts 

over the faces of the jurymen as the judge speaks, and we see that most of

their heads are turned to camera's 

left. NO. 7 looks down at his hands. NO. 3 looks off in another direction,

the direction in which the defendant 

would be sitting. NO. 10 keeps moving his head back and forth nervously.

The judge drones on.

JUDGE:

serious charge tried in our criminal 

courts. You've heard a long and complex case, gentlemen, and it is now your

duty to sit down to try and 

separate the facts from the fancy. One man is dead. The life of another is

Page 3/44



at stake. If there is a reasonable doubt 

in your minds as to the guilt of the accused . . . then you must declare

him not guilty. If, however, there is no 

reasonable doubt, then he must be found guilty. Whichever way you decide,

the verdict must be unanimous. I 

urge you to deliberate honestly and thoughtfully. You are faced with a

grave responsibility. Thank you, 

gentlemen.

[There is a long pause.]

CLERK:

[And now, slowly, almost hesitantly, the members of the jury begin to rise.

Awkwardly, they file out of the jury 

box and off camera to the left. Camera holds on jury box, and then fades

out].

[Fade in on a large bare, unpleasant-looking room. This is the jury room in

the county criminal court of a large 

Eastern city. It is about 4:00 P.M. The room is furnished with a long

conference table and a dozen chairs. The 

walls are bare, drab and badly in need of a fresh coat of paint. Along one

wall is a row of windows, which look 

out on the skyline of the city's financial district. High on another wall

is an electric clock. A washroom opens off 

the jury room. In one corner of the room is a water fountain. On the table

are pads, pencils, and ashtrays. One 

of the windows is open. Papers blow across the table and onto the floor as

the door opens. Lettered on the 

outside of the door are the words "Jury Room". A uniformed guard holds the

door open. Slowly, almost self-

consciously, the twelve jurors file in. The guard counts them as they enter

the door, his lips moving, but no 

sound coming forth. Four or five of the jurors light cigarettes as they

enter the room. Juror NO. 5 lights his 

pipe, which he smokes constantly throughout the play. Jurors NO. 2 and 12

go to the water fountain. NO. 9 

goes into the washroom, the door of which is lettered "Men." Several of the

jurors take seats at the table. Others 

stand awkwardly around the room. Several look out the windows. These are

men who are ill at ease, who do not 

really know each other to talk to and who wish they were anywhere but here.

NO. 7, standing at window, takes 

out a pack of gum, takes a piece, and offers it around. There are no

takers. He mops his brow.]

Page 4/44



NO. 7:

think they'd at least air condition the place. 

I almost dropped dead in court.

[NO. 7 opens the window a bit wider. The guard looks them over and checks

his count. Then, satisfied, he 

makes ready to leave.]

GUARD:

want, I'm right outside. Just knock.

[He exits, closing the door. Silently they all look at the door. We hear

the lock clicking.]

NO. 5:

NO. 10:

think? 

NO. 5:

[Some of the jurors are taking off their jackets. Others are sitting down

at the table. They still are reluctant to 

talk to each other. FOREMAN is at head of table, tearing slips of paper for

ballots. Now we get a close shot of 

NO. 8:

NO. 3:

talk. Did you ever hear so much talk about 

nothing?

NO. 2:

NO. 3:

system. Well, I suppose you can't say 

anything against it.

[NO.2 looks at him nervously, nods, and goes over to water cooler. Cut to

shot of NO. 8 staring out window. 

Cut to table. NO.7 stands at the table, puffing out a cigarette.] 

NO.7:

you ever hear a phonier story? 

NO.10:

you're dealing with. 

Page 5/44



NO.7:

NO.10:

[NO.7 nods sympathetically.]

FOREMAN:

NO.7:

Year Itch tonight. I must be the only guy in the 

whole world who hasn't seen it yet. (He laughs and sits down.) Okay, your

honor, start the show.

[They all begin to sit down. The foreman is seated at the head of the

table. NO. 8 continues to look out the

window.] 

FOREMAN:

[NO 8 turns, startled.]

FOREMAN:

NO. 8:

NO.10:

father. Bing! Just like that. Well, it's the element.

They let the kids run wild. Maybe it serves ‘em right.

FOREMAN:

NO.12:

: Is everybody here? 

NO.12:

[The foreman turns to the washroom just as the door opens. NO. 9 comes out,

embarrassed.]

FOREMAN:

NO.9:

FOREMAN:

[NO. 9 heads for a seat and sits down. They look at the foreman

expectantly.]

Page 6/44



FOREMAN:

want to. I mean, I'm not going to 

make any rules. If we want to discuss it first and then vote, that's one

way. Or we can vote right now to see how 

we stand.

NO.7:

NO. 10:

NO. 3:

FOREMAN:

There is no answer.) Okay, all those

voting guilty raise your hands.

[Seven or eight hands go up immediately. Several others go up more slowly.

Everyone looks around the table.

There are two hands not raised, NO. 9's and NO. 8's. NO. 9's hand goes up

slowly now as the foreman counts.] 

FOREMAN:

Not guilty? (NO. 8's hand is raised.) One. 

Right. Okay. Eleven to one, guilty. Now we know where we are.

NO. 3:

he's not guilty? 

NO. 8:

NO. 3:

and heard the same thing I did. The man's a

dangerous killer. You could see it. 

NO. 8:

NO. 3:

old kid. They proved it a dozen different ways. Do you want me to list

them? 

NO. 8:

NO. 10:

NO. 7:

NO. 8:

to raise my hand and send a boy off to die 

without talking about it first.

NO. 7:

NO. 8:

NO. 7:

You couldn't change my mind if you talked for a 

hundred years.

NO. 8:

while. Look, this boy's been kicked around all 

his life. You know, living in a slum, his mother dead since he was nine.

That's not a very good head start. He's a 

tough, angry kid. You know why slum kids get that way? Because we knock 'em

on the head once a day, every 

day. I think maybe we owe him a few words. That's all.

[He looks around the table. Some of them look back coldly. Some cannot look

at him. Only NO. 9 nods slowly. 

NO. 12 doodles steadily. NO. 4 begins to comb his hair.]

NO. 10:

thing. He got a fair trial, didn't he? You know 

what that trial cost? He's lucky he got it. Look, we're all grownups here.

You're not going to tell us that we're 

supposed to believe him, knowing what he is. I've lived among 'em all my

life. You can't believe a word they 

say. You know that.

NO. 9:

thing for a man to believe! Since when is 

dishonesty a group characteristic? You have no monopoly on the truth.

NO. 3 {interrupting) All right. It's not Sunday. We don't need a sermon.

NO. 9:

[NO. 8 puts his hand on NO. 9's arm and stops him. Somehow his touch and

his gentle expression calm the old

man. He draws a deep breath and relaxes.]

NO.4:

FOREMAN:

NO.11:

close the window.

(He gets up and does so.) (Apologetically) It was blowing on my neck. 

[NO. 10 blows his nose fiercely.]

NO. 12:

it seems to me that it's up to us to convince 

this gentleman (indicating NO. 8) that we're right and he's wrong. Maybe if

we each took a minute or two, you 

know, if we sort of try it on for size.

FOREMAN:

NO. 7:

FOREMAN:

NO.2:

guilty. I thought

it was obvious. I mean nobody proved otherwise.

NO. 8:

is on the prosecution. The defendant 

doesn't have to open his mouth. That's in the Constitution. The Fifth

Amendment. You've heard of it. 

NO. 2:

I . . . what

I meant . . . well, anyway, I think he was guilty. 

Page 9/44



NO.3:

man who lived on the second floor right 

underneath the room where the murder took place. At ten minutes after

twelve on the night of the killing he 

heard loud noises in the upstairs apartment. He said it sounded like a

fight. Then he heard the kid say to his 

father, "I'm gonna kill you.!” A second later he heard a body falling, and

he ran to the door of his apartment,

looked out, and saw the kid running down the stairs and out of the house.

Then he called the police. They found 

the father with a knife in his chest. 

FOREMAN:

NO. 4:

movies. That's a little ridiculous, isn't it? He

couldn't even remember what pictures he saw. 

NO. 3:

right. 

NO. 10:

testimony don't prove it, then nothing does. 

NO. 12:

FOREMAN:

NO. 10:

can't sleep. It's hot, you know. (He gets

up and begins to walk around, blowing his nose and talking.) Anyway, she

looks out the window and right 

across the street she sees the kid stick the knife into his father. She's

known the kid all his life. His window is 

right opposite hers, across the el tracks, and she swore she saw him do it.

NO. 8:

NO. 10:

windows of a passing el train at night 

and see what's happening on the other side. They proved it.

Page 10/44



NO. 8:

She's one of "them" too, isn't she: I'd like to ask you something. How come

you believed her? She's one of "them" too, isn't she?

[NO. 10 walks over to NO. 8:] 

NO. 10:

FOREMAN:

[NO. 3 gets up and goes to NO. 10:] 

NO.3:

you letting him get you all upset for?

Relax.

[NO. 10 and NO. 3 sit down.]

FOREMAN:

NO. 5:

FOREMAN:

NO.6:

with the testimony from those people across

the hall. Didn't they say something about an argument between the father

and the boy around seven o'clock that 

night? I mean, I can be wrong.

NO.11:

NO. 8:

boy twice and then saw the boy walk angrily out 

of the house. What does that prove?

NO. 6:

the picture. I didn't say it proved anything. 

FOREMAN:

NO. 6:

[NO. 6 goes to the water fountain.] 

FOREMAN:

Page 11/44



NO.7:

day about this thing, but I think we’re

wasting our time. Look at the kid's record. At fifteen he was in reform

school. He stole a car. He's been arrested 

for mugging. He was picked up for knife-fighting. I think they said he

stabbed somebody in the arm. This is a 

very fine boy.

NO. 8:

regularly. He used his fists. 

NO.7:

NO. 3:

don't listen. (Bitter) I've got a kid. When 

he was eight years old, he ran away from a fight. I saw him. I was so

ashamed, I told him right out, "I'm gonna 

make a man out of you or I'm gonna bust you up into little pieces trying."

When he was fifteen he hit me in the 

face. He's big, you know. I haven't seen him in three years. Rotten kid!

You work your heart out.... (Pause) All 

right, let's get on with it. 

3:

don't listen. (Bitter) I've got a kid. When 

he was eight years old, he ran away from a fight. I saw him. I was so

You work your heart out.... (Pause) All 

right, let's get on with it.

[Looks away embarrassed.]

NO. 4:

product of a filthy neighborhood and a broken 

home. We can't help that. We're not here to go into the reasons why slums

are breeding grounds for criminals. 

They are. I know it. So do you. The children who come out of slum

backgrounds are potential menaces to 

society.

NO. 10:

Page 12/44



[There is a dead silence for a moment, and then NO. 5 speaks haltingly.]

NO. 5:

NO. 10:

NO. 5:

Maybe it still smells on me. 

FOREMAN:

[NO. 5 stands up.]

NO. 5:

seeing everyone looking at him, sits down, 

fists clenched.] 

NO. 3:

Let's not be so sensitive. 

[There is a long pause.]

NO. 11:

FOREMAN:

8) It's your turn. 

NO. 8:

I felt that the defense counsel never really

conducted a thorough cross-examination. I mean, he was appointed by the

court to defend the boy. He hardly

seemed interested. Too many questions were left unasked. 

NO. 3 (annoyed). What about the ones that were asked? For instance, let's

talk about that cute little switchknife. 

You know, the one that fine, upright kid admitted buying.

NO. 8:

at it. I'd like to see it again, Mr. Foreman.

[The foreman looks at him questioningly and then gets up and goes to the

door. During the following dialogue 

the foreman knocks; the guard comes in; the foreman whispers to him; the

guard nods and leaves, locking the 

door.]

NO. 3:

look at it again. (To NO. 4) What do yo: We all know what it looks like. I

Page 13/44



don't see why we have to look at it again. (To NO. 4) What do you 

think? 

NO. 4:

NO. 4:

don't you agree?

NO. 8:

NO. 4:

switch knife. The storekeeper was arrested 

the following day when he admitted selling it to the boy. It's a very

unusual knife. The storekeeper identified it 

and said it was the only one of its kind he had in stock. Why did the boy

get it? (Sarcastically) As a present for 

a friend of his, he says. Am I right so far?

NO. 8:

NO. 3:

what he's talking about. 

NO. 4:

fallen through a hole in his coat pocket,

that he never saw it again. Now there's a story, gentlemen. You know what

actually happened. The boy took the 

knife home and a few hours later stabbed his father with it and even

remembered to wipe off the fingerprints.

[The door opens, and the guard walks in with an oddly designed knife with a

tag on it. NO. 4 gets up and takes 

it from him. The guard exits.]

NO. 4:

are you trying to tell me that someone 

picked it up off the street and went up to the boy's house and stabbed his

father with it just to be amusing?

Page 14/44



NO. 8:

and that someone else stabbed his father with 

a similar knife. It's possible.

[NO. 4 flips open the knife and jams it into the table.]

NO. 4:

never seen one like it before in my life and neither 

had the storekeeper who sold it to him.

[NO. 8 reaches casually into his pocket and withdraws an object. No one

notices this. He stands up quietly.]

NO. 4:

coincidence? 

NO. 8:

possible. 

NO. 3:

[NO. 8 swiftly flicks open the blade of a switch knife and jams it into the

table next to the first one. They are NO. 8 swiftly flicks open the blade

of a switch knife and jams it into the table next to the first one. They

are

exactly alike. There are several gasps and everyone stares at the knife.

There is a long silence.]

there are still eleven of us who think he's

guilty. You're alone. What do you think you're gonna accomplish? If you

want to be stubborn and hang this 

jury, he'll be tried again and found guilty, sure as he's born. 

NO. 8:

NO. 7:

NO. 9:

[NO. 7 glares at NO. 9 for a long while, but has no answer. NO. 8 looks

closely at NO. 9, and we can begin to 

sense a rapport between then,. There is a long silence. Then suddenly

everyone begins to talk at once.]

[We catch a close shot of NO. 5 looking steadily at him as he talks. NO. 5,

seemingly puzzled, listens closely.|

NO. 8:

votes for guilty, I won't stand alone. We'll take in a guilty verdict right

now. 

NO. 7:

FOREMAN:

[They all nod their heads. NO. 8 walks over to the window, looks out for a

moment and then faces them.]

FOREMAN:

[The foreman passes ballot slips to all of them, and now NO. 8 watches

then; tensely as they begin to write. 

Fade out.]

ACT 2

Fade in on same scene, no time lapse. NO. 8 stands tensely watching as the

jurors write on their ballots. He 

stays perfectly still as one by one they fold the ballots and pass them,

along to the foreman. The foreman takes 

them, riffles through the folded ballots, counts eleven, and now begins to

open them. He reads each one out 

loud and lays it aside. They watch him quietly, and all we hear is his

Page 17/44



voice and the sound of NO. 2 sucking on a 

cough drop.

FOREMAN:

Guilty. Guilty. 

(He pauses at the tenth ballot and then reads it.] Not Guilty. (NO. 3 slams

down hard on the table. The foreman 

opens the last ballot.) Guilty.

NO. 10:

NO. 7:

NO. 11:

point, no? If the gentleman wants it to remain 

secret…

NO. 3 (standing up angrily). What do you mean? There are no secrets in

here! I know who it was. (He turns to 

NO. 5) What's the matter with you? You come in here and you vote guilty and

then this slick preacher starts to 

tear your heart out with stories about a poor little kid who just couldn't

help becoming a murderer. So you 

change your vote. If that isn't the most sickening...

[NO. 5 stares at NO. 3, frightened at this outburst.]

FOREMAN:

NO. 3:

paying attention to fairy tales. 

NO. 5:

NO. 11:

unpopular opinions in this country. This is the reason I came here. I

wanted to have the right to disagree. In my 

own country, I am ashamed to say that. 

NO. 10:

NO. 7:

[There is a long pause as NO. 7 and NO. 5 eye each other angrily.]

NO. 9:

I did. (There is a pause.) Maybe you'd like to know why. 

NO. 3:

FOREMAN:

NO. 9:

alone against us. That's his right. It takes 

a great deal of courage to stand alone even if you believe in something

very strongly. He left the verdict up to 

us. He gambled for support, and I gave it to him. I want to hear more. The

vote is ten to two. 

: Thank you. (Pointing at NO. 8) This gentleman chose to stand alone

against us. That's his right. It takes 

a great deal of courage to stand alone even if you believe in something

very strongly. He left the verdict up to 

us. He gambled for support, and I gave it to him. I want to hear more. The

vote is ten to two.

NO. 10:

[Foreman gets up, goes to door, knocks, hands guard the tagged switch knife

and sits down again.]

NO. 3 (to NO. 5): Look, buddy, I was a little excited. Well, you know how

it is. I . . . I didn't mean to get 

nasty…nothing personal.

[NO. 5 looks at him.] 

NO. 7:

[NO. 12 gives it to him. He draws a tic-tac-toe square on the same sheet of

paper on which NO. 12 had drawn

the train. He fills in an X and hands the pencil to NO. 12]

NO. 3:

[NO. 12 takes the pencil. NO. 8 stands up and snatches the paper away. NO.

3 leaps up.] NO. 12 takes the pencil. NO. 8 stands up and snatches the

[He lets them sit him down. NO. 8 remains standing, holding the scrap of

paper. He looks at it closely now and 

seems to be suddenly interested in it. Then he throws it back toward NO. 3.

It lands in the center of the table. 

NO. 3 is angered again at this, but NO. 4 puts his hand on his arm. NO. 8

speaks now and his voice is more 

intense.]

that room and touch the el. Right? 

(Several of them nod.) All right. Now let me ask you this. Did anyone here

ever live right next to the el tracks? I 

have. When your window is open and the train goes by, the noise is almost

unbearable. You can't hear yourself 

think. 

: This. An el train passes a given point in ten seconds. That given point

is the window of the room in 

which the killing took place. You can almost reach out of the window of

that room and touch the el. Right?

front of the el was roaring past his

diagram of the spot where the body was 

found. At the back of the apartment we see the entrance into the apartment

Finally he and NO. 3 are the only ones 

left. NO. 3 turns around and sees that they are alone. Slowly he moves

toward the door. Then he stops at the

it. He holds it in the approved knife 

fighter fashion and looks long and hard at NO. 8, pointing the knife at his

belly. (NO .8 stares back. Then NO. 3 

turns the knife around. NO. 8 takes it by the handle. NO. 3 exits. NO. 8

closes the knife, puts it away and taking

scribbled the words "Not guilty. "
